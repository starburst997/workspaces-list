# Workspaces List

A VSCode/Cursor extension that lists all currently opened workspaces in a sidebar with Claude Code session status monitoring.

## Why Use This Extension

When working with multiple Cursor instances, it's easy to lose track of which workspace Claude is working on. This extension provides a single view of all open workspaces and shows real-time status of Claude Code sessions, making it easy to:

- See which workspaces have Claude running, executing tasks, or waiting for input
- Quickly switch between workspaces with a single click
- Monitor multiple AI-assisted projects simultaneously

## Features

### Workspace List

Displays all open VSCode/Cursor windows in the sidebar. Click any workspace to switch focus to that window.

### Claude Code Status Monitoring

Automatically monitors Claude Code activity in all workspaces and displays status badges:

- **WaitingForInput**: Claude needs your approval or input
- **Executing**: Claude is actively working (recent file activity)
- **RecentlyFinished**: Claude completed a task (shows time-based color gradient)
- **Running**: Claude process is running but idle
- **NotRunning**: No active Claude process
- **NoSession**: No Claude conversation found

Status updates occur at configurable intervals only when the extension window is focused.

### Browser Window Listing

Also displays open Safari and Chrome windows for quick access.

### Workspace Customization (Optional)

Add a `.workspaces-list.json` file in your workspace root to customize appearance:

```json
{
  "displayName": "My Project",
  "icon": "folder",
  "color": "#4ECDC4"
}
```

**Icon formats:**
- Codicons: `"folder"`, `"file"`, `"git-branch"`
- Emojis: `"ðŸš€"`, `"ðŸ“¦"`
- SVG: `"<svg>...</svg>"`
- File paths: `"./icon.png"` or absolute paths
- URLs: `"https://example.com/icon.png"`

## Requirements

- macOS (uses native window detection)
- VSCode 1.85.0+ or Cursor

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workspaces-list.git
cd workspaces-list
npm install
npm run compile
```

Press F5 in VSCode to run the extension.

## Usage

1. Open the "Workspaces" panel in the sidebar
2. View all open workspaces with their Claude status
3. Click a workspace to switch to it
4. Use the refresh button if needed

## Settings

All settings are optional. The extension works with defaults out of the box.

### `workspacesList.statusMonitorInterval`

- **Type:** number (milliseconds)
- **Default:** 5000
- **Description:** Interval for monitoring Claude Code status. Lower values provide faster updates but use more resources.

### `workspacesList.processMonitorInterval`

- **Type:** number (milliseconds)
- **Default:** 30000
- **Description:** Interval for scanning Claude Code processes. This detects when Claude starts or stops running.

### `workspacesList.executingThreshold`

- **Type:** number (milliseconds)
- **Default:** 30000
- **Description:** Time threshold for detecting executing status. File activity within this threshold indicates Claude is actively working.

### `workspacesList.waitingMessageAge`

- **Type:** number (milliseconds)
- **Default:** 10000
- **Description:** Minimum age for assistant messages to be considered as waiting for input. This prevents false positives during rapid execution.

## How It Works

The extension reads Cursor's workspace storage to discover open windows and monitors Claude Code's conversation cache (`~/.claude/projects/`) for activity. Status is determined by analyzing message timestamps and content.

## Known Limitations

- macOS only (uses system-specific window detection)
- Claude status detection is heuristic-based and may not be 100% accurate
